# Vorticity Projection Code

This code accepts an evolution.root 3D file and creates a .root file with 2D and 1D projections of energy, temperature, velocity and vorticity.

## Proj_main.cxx code

The [Proj_main_cxx](https://github.com/jbarbon/masters-project/blob/main/projection-code/Vorticity_Base/doMain/Projection_Class/src/Proj_main.cxx) code is where you will control your projections.
